[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency management tool for PHP.
It allows you to declare the packages your project depends on and manage (install/update/remove) them.
Sometimes you may need to know the exact versions of your installed packages,
article shows you how to do that using ***composer show*** and other commands.

## Check the versions of all installed packages

You can check which packages are installed in the current working directory by running one of the following commands - **show** or **info**:

```bash
composer show
# or
composer info
```

It shows you package names, versions and descriptions:

```
curl/curl                         2.5.0    cURL class for PHP
symfony/http-client               v6.3.2   Provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously
symfony/http-foundation           v6.3.4   Defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification
symfony/yaml                      v6.3.3   Loads and dumps YAML files
```

## Check the versions of globally installed packages

Sometimes you may need to check which packages are installed globally in the system. The **show** command should be run with the **global** keyword:

```bash
composer global show
```

And you will see a list similar to the previous one, but containing only globally installed packages:

```
curl/curl 2.5.0 cURL class for PHP
```

## Check the version of a particular package

For example, if you want to check which version of **symfony/http-foundation** is installed, you can do this as follows:

```bash
composer show symfony/http-foundation
```

It will give you a lot of information about the package: name, description, version, requirements, conflicting packages and much more:

```plaintext
name     : symfony/http-foundation
descrip. : Defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification
keywords :
versions : * v6.3.4
type     : library
...
requires
php >=8.1
symfony/deprecation-contracts ^2.5|^3
symfony/polyfill-mbstring ~1.1
symfony/polyfill-php83 ^1.27
...
conflicts
symfony/cache <6.2
```

You can grep the versions only:

```bash
composer show symfony/http-foundation | grep versions
# output
versions : * v6.3.4
```

The same results can be obtained by using the **info** command:

```bash
composer info symfony/http-foundation | grep versions
# output
versions : * v6.3.4
```

## Check package versions from a specific author/vendor

If you want to check the package version from a specific author/vendor,
for example check the versions of the installed [Symfony](https://symfony.com) components,
you can pass a package mask using wildcards:

```bash
composer show "symfony/*"
```

It will only show packages that start with **symfony/**

```plaintext
symfony/http-client               v6.3.2   Provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously
symfony/http-foundation           v6.3.4   Defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification
symfony/yaml                      v6.3.3   Loads and dumps YAML files
```

## Check why the package was installed

The **composer show** command displays a list of all installed packages
and you may find some unfamiliar names in this list,
e.g. libraries you haven't installed, but which are present in your application.
If you are curious about how this happened, you can run the **why** or **depends** command:

```bash
composer why symfony/service-contracts
# or
composer depends symfony/service-contracts
```

It tells you which other packages depend on a particular package and why it was installed even though it was not directly required:

```plaintext
symfony/http-client  v6.3.2  requires   symfony/service-contracts (^2.5|^3)
symfony/translation  v6.3.3  conflicts  symfony/service-contracts (<2.5)
```

## Summary

Composer helps you manage your dependencies and keep track of which version of certain packages are installed..
The **composer show** or **composer info** commands can be used to find out the exact version of a composer package.

The **composer why** or **composer depends** commands are also useful to check why a particular package is installed
or what other packages need it and in what version.
